- **Description**: Implement comprehensive UI features from bash version

#### Missing Features
- [ ] **File Count Display**: Show "Files: Main(X) Archive(Y) Output(Z) Error(W)" before each menu
- [ ] **File Preview in Verbose Mode**: Show up to 5 PDF files with sizes when verbose enabled
- [ ] **File Size Display**: Show file sizes during operations in verbose mode
- [ ] **Colored Output**: Implement color-coded messages (Red=Error, Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Blue=Info)
- [ ] **Session Statistics**: Track and display successful operations, errors, and elapsed time on exit
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Show detailed operation progress in verbose mode

#### Implementation Requirements
- Add file counting functions for each directory
- Implement verbose mode file listing with size information

- Update all user messages with appropriate colors

### 2. Advanced PDF Processing Features
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Missing Core Logic
- **Description**: Implement sophisticated PDF processing logic from bash version

- **Description**: Performance optimizations and reliability improvements

#### Features to Consider
- [ ] **Large File Handling**: Optimize for very large PDF files
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Implement memory usage monitoring
- [ ] **Concurrent Processing**: Consider parallel processing for multiple files
- [ ] **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement recovery from partial failures

## Performance Optimization (Phase 4: Advanced Features)

### 9. Implement In-Memory Processing Approach
- **Priority**: Performance Enhancement
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Description**: Replace current file-based merging with hybrid in-memory approach to reduce temporary file usage
- **Benefits**: 
  - 52.9% memory efficiency vs original files
  - Reduced disk I/O operations
  - Better error handling for problematic PDF pages
  - Faster processing with minimal temporary files

#### Implementation Details
- **Research Completed**: ✅ (Tests 09-16 in `/tests/` directory)
- **API Knowledge**: ✅ (Documented in `/docs/api_knowledge.md`)
- **Approach Validated**: ✅ (Hybrid approach in `test16_final_memory_approach.go`)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Load PDFs into memory** as byte arrays for validation
2. **Use `api.ReadContextFile()`** for reliable context creation
3. **Validate page counts** in memory before processing
4. **Extract pages with minimal temp files** using error handling
5. **Keep extracted pages in memory** as byte arrays
6. **Final merge from memory** with proper cleanup

#### Files to Modify
- `main.go` - Update merge logic in interactive menu
- `pdfops.go` - Replace `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `fileops.go` - May need updates for temp file handling

#### Reference Implementation
- See `tests/test16_final_memory_approach.go` for working example
- See `docs/memory_processing_summary.md` for implementation pattern

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Merging uses minimal temporary files (only during page extraction)
- [ ] Original PDF data kept in memory throughout process
- [ ] Graceful handling of pages that fail extraction
- [ ] Memory usage ~50% of original file sizes
- [ ] Proper cleanup of all temporary files
- [ ] Maintains existing interleaved merge pattern (A1, B3, A2, B2, A3, B1)

#### Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour
