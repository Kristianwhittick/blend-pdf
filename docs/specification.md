# BlendPDFGo Specification

## Overview
A tool for merging PDF files with special handling for double-sided scanning workflows.

## âœ… Implemented Core Requirements

### PDF Merging âœ…
- Merge exactly 2 PDF documents
- Both documents must have the exact same number of pages
- If page counts don't match, error out immediately and move files to error directory
- The second document's pages are in reverse order and need to be processed in reverse during merging

### Smart Page Reversal Logic âœ…
- **Single-page second file**: Direct merge (no reversal needed)
- **Multi-page second file**: Create temporary reversed copy, then merge
- Use `pdfcpu collect -p pages,in,reverse,order` for page reversal
- Clean up temporary reversed files after processing

### Merging Pattern âœ…
- Use interleaved merging pattern: Doc1_Page1, Doc2_Page3, Doc1_Page2, Doc2_Page2, Doc1_Page3, Doc2_Page1
- Final output should alternate between pages from first document and corresponding reversed pages from second document
- The second document's pages are processed in reverse order (last page first, first page last)

### File Handling âœ…
- **Success**: Move both input files to `archive/` directory, place merged PDF in `output/` directory
- **Error**: Move both input files to `error/` directory if page counts don't match or processing fails
- **File Selection**: Automatically select the first two PDF files found in the directory (sorted alphabetically)

### Output Naming âœ…
- Combine both input filenames with hyphen separator
- Format: `FirstFileName-SecondFileName.pdf`
- Example: `Doc_A.pdf` + `Doc_B.pdf` â†’ `Doc_A-Doc_B.pdf`

### Validation âœ…
- Validate that both files are valid PDF documents before processing
- Check exact page count match (no tolerance for differences)
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures

## âœ… Implemented User Interface Requirements

### File Count Display âœ…
- Show real-time file counts before each menu prompt
- Format: `Files: Main(X) Archive(Y) Output(Z) Error(W)`
- Update counts dynamically after each operation

### Verbose Mode Features âœ…
- **File Preview**: Show up to 5 PDF files with sizes when verbose enabled
- **File Size Display**: Show file sizes during operations
- **Page Information**: Display page counts and reversal details
- **Command Output**: Show detailed pdfcpu command execution
- **Toggle Support**: Allow runtime toggling of verbose mode

### Colored Output âœ…
- **Red**: Error messages and failures
- **Green**: Success messages and confirmations
- **Yellow**: Warnings and informational messages
- **Blue**: File names, paths, and data values
- **No Color**: Default text and prompts

### Session Statistics âœ…
- Track successful operations during session
- Track failed operations and errors
- Calculate elapsed time from start to exit
- Display comprehensive statistics on program exit

### Interactive Menu âœ…
- **S** - Move single PDF to output directory
- **M** - Merge two PDFs with smart reversal logic
- **H** - Show comprehensive help information
- **V** - Toggle verbose mode on/off
- **D** - Toggle debug mode on/off
- **Q** - Quit program with statistics display

## âœ… Implemented Command Line Interface

### Flags and Arguments âœ…
- `-h, --help`: Show comprehensive help information and exit
- `-v, --version`: Show version information and exit
- `-V, --verbose`: Enable verbose mode from startup
- `-D, --debug`: Enable debug mode (includes verbose + structured logging)
- `[folder]`: Specify folder path to watch (default: current directory)

### Combined Options âœ…
- Support multiple flags together: `-V /path/to/folder`, `-D /path/to/folder`
- Validate folder paths and show clear error messages
- Handle both relative and absolute paths

### Help Output âœ…
```

  blendpdfgo -V                # Run in verbose mode
  blendpdfgo -D                # Run in debug mode
  blendpdfgo /path/to/pdfs     # Watch specific folder
  blendpdfgo -V /path/to/pdfs  # Verbose mode with specific folder
  blendpdfgo                   # Watch current directory

## âœ… Implemented Directory Structure
```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/     # Successfully processed input files
â”œâ”€â”€ output/      # Final merged PDF files and single file moves
â”œâ”€â”€ error/       # Files that couldn't be processed
â””â”€â”€ [input PDFs] # Source PDF files to be processed
