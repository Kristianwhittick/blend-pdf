## 2. Completed Tasks (Git Commit Order)

### Task 1: Fix getPageCount Function
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requirements**: R1.6 (PDF validation), R10.1 (PDF structure validation)
- **Description**: Fixed the `getPageCount` function to use correct pdfcpu API (`api.PageCountFile`)

- **Solution**: Replaced with `api.PageCountFile(file)` which directly returns page count

### Task 2: Implement Page Count Validation
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requirements**: R1.2 (exact page count match), R1.3 (error handling), R10.4-R10.6 (page count validation)
- **Description**: Added exact page count validation between two PDFs
- **Implementation**: 
  - Get page counts for both files
  - Compare for exact match (no tolerance)
  - Move files to error/ directory if counts don't match
  - Display clear error messages

### Task 3: Fix Merging Logic for Interleaved Pattern
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requirements**: R1.1 (merge 2 PDFs), R1.4-R1.5 (interleaved pattern), R2.1-R2.4 (smart page reversal)

- **Cancellation Reason**: Issue already reported and resolved in pdfcpu issue #950
- **Resolution**: pdfcpu maintainer confirmed `trim` command sorts pages by design; `collect` command preserves order
- **Action**: Use `api.CollectFile()` instead of `api.TrimFile()` for order-preserving page extraction

### Task 25: pdfcpu Feature Request for In-Memory Processing
- **Status**: 📋 PLANNED
- **Priority**: Community Contribution (Low)
- **Description**: Create GitHub feature request for in-memory PDF processing capabilities in pdfcpu
- **Background**: Current pdfcpu API requires file-based operations, limiting true in-memory processing

#### Feature Request Details
- **Missing Functions**: Context-based page extraction and merging
- **Proposed APIs**:
  - `api.ExtractPagesContext(ctx *model.Context, pages []int) ([]*model.Context, error)`
  - `api.MergeContexts(contexts []*model.Context) (*model.Context, error)`
  - `api.TrimContext(ctx *model.Context, pages []string) (*model.Context, error)`
- **Use Case**: Enable zero-temp-file PDF processing for better performance and resource usage
- **Benefits**: Reduced disk I/O, better memory efficiency, cleaner application architecture

#### Implementation Requirements
1. **Research existing issues** - Check if similar requests exist
2. **Prepare technical specification** - Detail proposed API functions with signatures
3. **Include use case examples** - Show how it would improve applications like BlendPDFGo
4. **Reference current limitations** - Document file-based workarounds currently needed
5. **Provide implementation suggestions** - If possible, suggest approach for pdfcpu maintainers

#### Deliverables
- [ ] GitHub issue research and analysis
- [ ] Technical specification document
- [ ] Feature request markdown for review
- [ ] GitHub issue submission
- [ ] Follow-up on maintainer feedback

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive feature request submitted to pdfcpu repository

- [ ] Maintainer feedback received and documented
- [ ] Task status updated based on maintainer response

#### Estimated Effort
- **Research**: 1 hour
- **Documentation**: 2-3 hours  
- **Submission and follow-up**: 1 hour

### Task 24: Implement CollectFile for Order-Preserving Page Extraction
- **Status**: 📋 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- **Requirements**: R2.1-R2.4 (smart page reversal), R1.4-R1.5 (interleaved pattern)
- **Priority**: Code Quality Enhancement (Medium)
- **Description**: Replace TrimFile with CollectFile for guaranteed page order preservation
- **Background**: pdfcpu issue #950 confirmed that `trim` command sorts pages by design, while `collect` preserves order

#### Implementation Details
- **Research Completed**: ✅ (Experiments 17-18 confirm CollectFile availability and strategy)
- **API Compatibility**: ✅ (Identical function signature to TrimFile)
- **Drop-in Replacement**: ✅ (No parameter changes required)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Replace TrimFile calls** with CollectFile in `createInterleavedMerge()` function
2. **Maintain existing error handling** - same error patterns expected
3. **Preserve current functionality** - no behavior changes for users
4. **Update function comments** to reflect the change from workaround to proper solution

#### Files to Modify
- `pdfops.go` - Update `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `docs/api_knowledge.md` - Update status from workaround to proper solution

#### Benefits
- **Guaranteed Order**: No more reliance on workaround for page ordering
- **Cleaner Code**: Removes need for individual page extraction workaround
- **Future-Proof**: Aligns with pdfcpu library design intentions
- **Better Maintainability**: Uses intended API functions

#### Implementation Strategy
```go
// Current approach (workaround):
for i := pageCount; i >= 1; i-- {
    pageSelection, _ := api.ParsePageSelection(fmt.Sprintf("%d", i))
    err := api.TrimFile(inputFile, pageFile, pageSelection, conf)
    // Individual extractions to work around sorting
}

// New approach (proper solution):
pageSelection, _ := api.ParsePageSelection("3,2,1")
err := api.CollectFile(inputFile, reversedFile, pageSelection, conf)
// Then extract individual pages from reversed file for interleaving
```

#### Important Notes
- **Temp Files**: This change does NOT reduce temporary file count (still 6 temp files + 1 lock file)
- **Purpose**: Code quality improvement, not performance optimization
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - same number of operations, cleaner implementation
- **For Temp File Reduction**: See Task 14 (In-Memory Processing) in backlog

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TrimFile calls replaced with CollectFile where order matters
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved (same interleaved pattern)
- [ ] Error handling maintains same behavior
- [ ] Tests pass with new implementation
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect proper solution

#### Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 1-2 hours
- **Testing**: 1 hour
- **Documentation**: 30 minutes

#### Suggested Commit Message
```
feat: Replace TrimFile with CollectFile for order-preserving extraction

- Use api.CollectFile() instead of api.TrimFile() for page reversal
