## 2. Completed Tasks (Git Commit Order)

### Task 1: Fix getPageCount Function
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed the `getPageCount` function to use correct pdfcpu API (`api.PageCountFile`)
- **Issue**: Was trying to use `api.PDFInfo` with incorrect parameters
- **Solution**: Replaced with `api.PageCountFile(file)` which directly returns page count

### Task 2: Implement Page Count Validation
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Description**: Added exact page count validation between two PDFs
- **Implementation**: 
  - Get page counts for both files
  - Compare for exact match (no tolerance)
  - Move files to error/ directory if counts don't match
  - Display clear error messages

### Task 3: Fix Merging Logic for Interleaved Pattern
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Rewrote merging logic to create interleaved pattern (Doc1_Page1, Doc2_Page3, Doc1_Page2, Doc2_Page2, Doc1_Page3, Doc2_Page1)
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `createInterleavedMerge` function
  - Extract individual pages from both documents
  - Second document pages processed in reverse order
  - Merge pages in alternating pattern
  - Clean up temporary files
- **Bug Fix (2025-08-27)**: Fixed page reversal logic
  - **Issue**: `api.TrimFile` with comma-separated selection "3,2,1" was not reordering pages
  - **Solution**: Extract pages individually in reverse order and merge manually
  - **Result**: Correct interleaved pattern: A1, *, A2, 9, A3, M

### Task 4: Update Filename Generation
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Updated output filename to combine both input names with hyphen separator
- **Format**: `FirstFileName-SecondFileName.pdf`
