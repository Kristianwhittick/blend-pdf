## 2. Completed Tasks (Git Commit Order)

### Task 1: Fix getPageCount Function
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed the `getPageCount` function to use correct pdfcpu API (`api.PageCountFile`)
- **Issue**: Was trying to use `api.PDFInfo` with incorrect parameters
- **Solution**: Replaced with `api.PageCountFile(file)` which directly returns page count

### Task 2: Implement Page Count Validation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **Description**: Added exact page count validation between two PDFs
- **Implementation**: 
  - Get page counts for both files
  - Compare for exact match (no tolerance)
  - Move files to error/ directory if counts don't match
  - Display clear error messages

### Task 3: Fix Merging Logic for Interleaved Pattern
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Rewrote merging logic to create interleaved pattern (Doc1_Page1, Doc2_Page3, Doc1_Page2, Doc2_Page2, Doc1_Page3, Doc2_Page1)
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `createInterleavedMerge` function
  - Extract individual pages from both documents
  - Second document pages processed in reverse order
  - Merge pages in alternating pattern
  - Clean up temporary files
- **Bug Fix (2025-08-27)**: Fixed page reversal logic
  - **Issue**: `api.TrimFile` with comma-separated selection "3,2,1" was not reordering pages
  - **Solution**: Extract pages individually in reverse order and merge manually
  - **Result**: Correct interleaved pattern: A1, *, A2, 9, A3, M

### Task 4: Update Filename Generation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Updated output filename to combine both input names with hyphen separator

### Task 14: Implement In-Memory Processing Approach (Phase 4)
- **Status**: üîÑ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (ON HOLD)
- **Priority**: Performance Enhancement (Optional)
- **Description**: Replace current file-based merging with hybrid in-memory approach to reduce temporary file usage
- **Benefits**: 
  - 52.9% memory efficiency vs original files
  - Reduced disk I/O operations
  - Better error handling for problematic PDF pages
  - Faster processing with minimal temporary files

#### Implementation Details
- **Research Completed**: ‚úÖ (Experiments 09-16 in `/experiments/` directory)
- **API Knowledge**: ‚úÖ (Documented in `/docs/api_knowledge.md`)
- **Approach Validated**: ‚úÖ (Hybrid approach in `experiment16_final_memory_approach.go`)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Load PDFs into memory** as byte arrays for validation
2. **Use `api.ReadContextFile()`** for reliable context creation
3. **Validate page counts** in memory before processing
4. **Extract pages with minimal temp files** using error handling
5. **Keep extracted pages in memory** as byte arrays
6. **Final merge from memory** with proper cleanup

#### Files to Modify
- `main.go` - Update merge logic in interactive menu
- `pdfops.go` - Replace `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `fileops.go` - May need updates for temp file handling

#### Reference Implementation
- See `experiments/experiment16_final_memory_approach.go` for working example
- See `docs/memory_processing_summary.md` for implementation pattern
- See `docs/api_knowledge.md` for API reference

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Merging uses minimal temporary files (only during page extraction)
- [ ] Original PDF data kept in memory throughout process
- [ ] Graceful handling of pages that fail extraction
- [ ] Memory usage ~50% of original file sizes
- [ ] Proper cleanup of all temporary files
- [ ] Maintains existing interleaved merge pattern (A1, B3, A2, B2, A3, B1)

#### Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour

#### Suggested Commit Message
```
