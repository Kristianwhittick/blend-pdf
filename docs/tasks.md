## ‚úÖ Done









### T-046: Fix Multi-Output Folder Creation Logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-02 | **Story**: US-005
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 2 hours

**Description**: Fixed directory creation logic to not create default output folder when using `-o` flag and create multi-output folders at startup

**Completion Notes**: Successfully implemented both parts of the fix. The application now correctly handles multi-output folder creation with consistent timing and proper conditional logic.

**Implementation Details**:
- Modified `createRequiredDirectories()` function in fileops.go
- Added conditional logic to check `CONFIG.OutputFolders` before creating default output
- Skip default `output/` folder creation when `-o` flag is used
- Create multi-output folders at startup alongside `archive/` and `error/`
- Used `append(dirs, CONFIG.OutputFolders...)` for cleaner code
- All folder creation now happens consistently at startup

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Default behavior: `./blend-pdf` creates `archive/`, `output/`, `error/`
- ‚úÖ Multi-output: `./blend-pdf -o "test1,test2,test3"` creates `archive/`, `error/`, `test1/`, `test2/`, `test3/` (no `output/`)
- ‚úÖ Operations work correctly with pre-created folders
- ‚úÖ File counts update properly: archive(1), test1(1), test2(1), test3(1)

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Consistent Timing**: All folders created at startup, not during operations
- **Logical Behavior**: No default output folder when using custom output folders
- **Better UX**: Users see all folders immediately after startup
- **No Regression**: Default single-output behavior unchanged
- **Cleaner Code**: Simplified logic with proper conditional handling

---

### T-045: Fix Multi-Output Folder Path Display ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-03 | **Story**: US-006
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 1 hour

**Description**: Fixed multi-output folder UI to show absolute paths instead of relative paths for consistency

**Completion Notes**: Successfully implemented absolute path display for multi-output folders. The UI now shows full absolute paths for all output folders, maintaining consistency with single output folder display.

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `filepath.Abs()` calls to convert relative paths to absolute paths
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback to original path
- Applied to both single and multi-output folder display logic
- Maintained proper %-59s %6d alignment within 80-character banner width
- Preserved file count accuracy and real-time updates

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Path Consistency**: Multi-output folders now show absolute paths like single output
- **Better UX**: Users see full paths for clarity and consistency
- **Error Resilience**: Fallback to original path if absolute path conversion fails
- **Maintained Formatting**: Proper alignment preserved within banner width
- **Real-time Updates**: File counts continue to update correctly

### T-037: Lock File Cleanup Investigation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-06 | **Story**: US-010
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 2 hours

**Description**: Investigated and fixed lock file cleanup to ensure proper release on application exit

**Completion Notes**: Successfully implemented stale lock file detection and automatic cleanup. The application now detects lock files from terminated processes and removes them automatically on startup, while preserving protection against concurrent instances.

**Root Cause Identified**: Lock files were not cleaned up when processes terminated abnormally (SIGKILL, crashes, forced termination). Signal handling was working correctly for SIGINT/SIGTERM, but SIGKILL cannot be caught.

**Implementation Details**:
- Added PID validation in `checkExistingLockFile()` function
- Implemented `isLockFileStale()` to check if process is still running
- Uses `process.Signal(syscall.Signal(0))` to test process existence on Unix
- Automatically removes stale lock files with informative logging
- Maintains protection against concurrent instances with valid PIDs
- Added syscall import for process validation

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Stale lock files (non-existent PIDs) automatically removed
- ‚úÖ Active lock files (valid PIDs) preserved and protected
- ‚úÖ Normal signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) continues to work
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown cleanup still functions correctly
- ‚úÖ No stale lock files accumulate from testing

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Stale lock files removed without manual intervention
- **Robust Detection**: PID validation ensures accurate stale file identification
- **Preserved Protection**: Concurrent instance prevention still works correctly
- **Better UX**: No more manual lock file removal required
- **Reliable Operation**: Eliminates lock file accumulation from abnormal termination

### T-044: Fix Multi-Output Folder UI Display ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-03 | **Story**: US-006
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 3 hours

**Description**: Fixed UI banner to show multi-output folders instead of single output folder when using `-o` flag

**Completion Notes**: Successfully implemented multi-output folder display in UI banner. The banner now shows individual folder counts and updates in real-time when using multi-output folders.

**Implementation Details**:
- Modified `EnhancedMenu` struct to use `outputFolders []string` instead of single `outputDir`
- Updated `NewEnhancedMenu` function signature to accept multiple output folders
- Enhanced `showHeader()` method to display multiple folders with individual counts
- Added logic to show "X folders" with total count and individual folder details
- Maintained 80-character width compatibility with proper alignment

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Multi-Output Display**: Shows "3 folders" with total count when using `-o "folder1,folder2,folder3"`
- **Individual Counts**: Displays individual folder counts for first 2 folders
- **Real-time Updates**: File counts update correctly after operations
- **Banner Layout**: Maintains proper alignment within 80-character width
- **Backward Compatibility**: Single output folder display unchanged

---

### T-043: Fix Multi-Output Folder Parsing Bug ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-02 | **Story**: US-005
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 2 hours

**Description**: Fixed bug where `-o "folder1,folder2,folder3"` was treated as watch directory instead of separate output folders

**Completion Notes**: Fixed multi-output folder functionality by correcting command line argument parsing and adding automatic directory creation. The application now properly creates separate output directories and copies files to all specified folders.

**Implementation Details**:
- Fixed `parseArgs()` function to properly skip `-o` flag parameters
- Updated `processArgument()` to return skip flag for parameter handling
- Enhanced `performFileCopy()` to create destination directories automatically
- Corrected watch directory detection to ignore output folder parameters

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Proper Directory Handling**: Creates separate `test1/`, `test2/`, `test3/` directories
- **Correct Watch Directory**: Uses current directory instead of output folder list
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Creates output directories when they don't exist
- **Multi-Output File Operations**: Successfully copies files to all specified output folders

---

### T-041: Fix Header Formatting for Large File Counts ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Epic**: E-03 | **Story**: US-006
**Completed**: Sep 23 | **Actual Time**: 1 hour

**Description**: Fixed header display formatting when file counts become large numbers (100+)

**Completion Notes**: Fixed header formatting alignment issue through multiple iterations. Final solution uses `%-59s %6d` format to properly align numbers within the 80-character border width.

**Implementation Details**:
- Modified `showHeader()` method in `ui/enhanced_menu.go`
- **Final format**: `%-59s %6d` (59-char left-aligned path + 6-char right-aligned number)
- **Width calculation**: Label(9) + Path(59) + Space(3) + Number(6) = 77 characters total
- **Border compatibility**: Fits within 80-character border (77 content + 2 border chars + 1 newline)
- Supports file counts up to 999,999 with consistent right-alignment

**Debugging Process**:
- **Initial attempts failed** due to width calculation errors (tried 57, 61, 62 character widths)
- **Root cause**: Content was 3 characters too wide, causing overflow beyond border
- **Solution method**: Manual character counting and border width measurement using `wc -m`
- **Testing**: Verified with both short paths (blend-pdf) and long paths (scan) directories

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Consistent Alignment**: Numbers appear at same position regardless of path length
- **Large Number Support**: Handles counts up to 999,999 without overflow
- **Visual Consistency**: Clean bordered layout maintained across all scenarios
- **Professional Appearance**: Proper alignment for 1-6 digit numbers

**Knowledge Documented**: Created `docs/alignment-checking-knowledge.md` with debugging techniques and lessons learned for future UI alignment work.

  - Implement basic text-based interface for legacy terminals
  - Maintain full functionality with simplified display
  - Test on PowerShell 5, CMD, and Windows Console Host
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Application works on PowerShell 5 without garbled output

  - Implement restore commands for single file moves and merge operations
  - Add [U]ndo option to main menu
  - Validate files still exist before restore attempt

  - **Merge Undo**: Move original files from archive/ back to main/, delete merged file from all output folders
  - **Consistent Result**: Both operations restore clean "pre-operation" state with files only in main/
  - **Archive Preservation**: Keep archive copies (they serve as backups)
- **File Conflict Handling**:
  - **Current Issue**: Copy operations overwrite existing files silently, move operations generate unique names
  - **Required Fix**: All operations (copy/move to output/archive/error) must use conflict resolution
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Generate unique names (`document_1.pdf`, `document_2.pdf`) instead of overwriting
  - **Undo Tracking**: Track actual filenames used (including `_1`, `_2` suffixes) for accurate undo restoration
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Can undo last single file move (move from first output back to main, delete from other outputs)
  - [ ] Can undo last merge operation (move files from archive back to main, remove merged output from all folders)
  - [ ] Clear undo history after successful undo operation
  - [ ] Show appropriate messages when undo is not available
