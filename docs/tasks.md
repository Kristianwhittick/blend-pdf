## 2. Completed Tasks (Git Commit Order)

### Task 1: Fix getPageCount Function
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requirements**: R1.6 (PDF validation), R10.1 (PDF structure validation)
- **Description**: Fixed the `getPageCount` function to use correct pdfcpu API (`api.PageCountFile`)
- **Issue**: Was trying to use `api.PDFInfo` with incorrect parameters
- **Solution**: Replaced with `api.PageCountFile(file)` which directly returns page count

### Task 2: Implement Page Count Validation
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Requirements**: R1.2 (exact page count match), R1.3 (error handling), R10.4-R10.6 (page count validation)
- **Description**: Added exact page count validation between two PDFs

  - Move files to error/ directory if counts don't match
  - Display clear error messages

### Task 3: Fix Merging Logic for Interleaved Pattern
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

  - Extract individual pages from both documents
  - Second document pages processed in reverse order

## 4. Backlog Items (On Hold)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: These backlog items are **NOT TO BE WORKED ON** until explicitly moved to "Next Stages" section by request. They are documented here for future reference only.

### Task 14: Implement In-Memory Processing Approach (Phase 4)
- **Status**: 🔄 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (ON HOLD)
- **Requirements**: R14.4-R14.6 (performance requirements), R2.1-R2.4 (smart page reversal), R13.4-R13.7 (temporary file management)
- **Priority**: Performance Enhancement (Optional)
- **Description**: Replace current file-based merging with hybrid in-memory approach to reduce temporary file usage
- **Benefits**: 
  - 52.9% memory efficiency vs original files
  - Reduced disk I/O operations
  - Better error handling for problematic PDF pages
  - Faster processing with minimal temporary files

#### Implementation Details
- **Research Completed**: ✅ (Experiments 09-16 in `/experiments/` directory)
- **API Knowledge**: ✅ (Documented in `/docs/api_knowledge.md`)
- **Approach Validated**: ✅ (Hybrid approach in `experiment16_final_memory_approach.go`)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Load PDFs into memory** as byte arrays for validation
2. **Use `api.ReadContextFile()`** for reliable context creation
3. **Validate page counts** in memory before processing
4. **Extract pages with minimal temp files** using error handling
5. **Keep extracted pages in memory** as byte arrays
6. **Final merge from memory** with proper cleanup

#### Files to Modify
- `main.go` - Update merge logic in interactive menu
- `pdfops.go` - Replace `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `fileops.go` - May need updates for temp file handling

#### Reference Implementation
- See `experiments/experiment16_final_memory_approach.go` for working example
- See `docs/memory_processing_research.md` for implementation pattern
- See `docs/api_knowledge.md` for API reference

#### Important Notes
- **Hybrid Approach**: Not pure in-memory due to pdfcpu API limitations
- **Temp Files**: Reduces from 7 to 2-3 files (not zero due to API constraints)
- **API Limitation**: pdfcpu requires file paths for page extraction and merging
- **For Zero Temp Files**: See Task 25 (pdfcpu feature request) for true in-memory processing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Merging uses minimal temporary files (only during page extraction)
- [ ] Original PDF data kept in memory throughout process
- [ ] Graceful handling of pages that fail extraction
- [ ] Memory usage ~50% of original file sizes
- [ ] Proper cleanup of all temporary files
- [ ] Maintains existing interleaved merge pattern (A1, B3, A2, B2, A3, B1)

#### Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour

#### Suggested Commit Message
```
perf: Add hybrid in-memory PDF processing

- Load PDFs into memory for validation
