# Development Planning and Future Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Development (Phase 4)

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
```
perf: Add hybrid in-memory PDF processing

- Load PDFs into memory for validation
- Use minimal temporary files during operations
- Implement graceful handling of extraction failures
- Achieve ~50% memory efficiency vs original approach
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Implementation Approach

### For Phase 4 Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/in-memory-processing
# Make changes and commits
git commit -m "perf: implement hybrid memory approach"
# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/in-memory-processing
```

### Implementation Files to Modify
- `main.go` - Update merge logic in interactive menu
- `pdfops.go` - Replace `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `fileops.go` - May need updates for temp file handling

### Reference Implementation
- See `tests/test16_final_memory_approach.go` for working example
- See `docs/memory_processing_summary.md` for implementation pattern
- See `docs/api_knowledge.md` for API reference

---

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
- Review existing research in `/tests/` directory
- Study memory processing approach in test16
- Plan integration with existing error handling

### Implementation Phase
- Follow hybrid approach from research
- Maintain existing user interface
- Preserve all error handling and validation

### Testing Phase
- Verify memory efficiency improvements
- Test with various PDF sizes and types
- Ensure no regression in functionality
