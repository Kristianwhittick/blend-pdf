## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Fix getPageCount Function

  - Get page counts for both files
  - Compare for exact match (no tolerance)
  - Move files to error/ directory if counts don't match
  - Display clear error messages

### 3. Fix Merging Logic for Interleaved Pattern

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks

### 14. Implement In-Memory Processing Approach (Phase 4, Task 9)
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- **Priority**: Performance Enhancement (Optional)
- **Description**: Replace current file-based merging with hybrid in-memory approach to reduce temporary file usage
- **Benefits**: 
  - 52.9% memory efficiency vs original files
  - Reduced disk I/O operations
  - Better error handling for problematic PDF pages
  - Faster processing with minimal temporary files

#### Implementation Details
- **Research Completed**: âœ… (Tests 09-16 in `/tests/` directory)
- **API Knowledge**: âœ… (Documented in `/docs/api_knowledge.md`)
- **Approach Validated**: âœ… (Hybrid approach in `test16_final_memory_approach.go`)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Load PDFs into memory** as byte arrays for validation
2. **Use `api.ReadContextFile()`** for reliable context creation
3. **Validate page counts** in memory before processing
4. **Extract pages with minimal temp files** using error handling
5. **Keep extracted pages in memory** as byte arrays
6. **Final merge from memory** with proper cleanup

#### Files to Modify
- `main.go` - Update merge logic in interactive menu
- `pdfops.go` - Replace `createInterleavedMerge()` function
- `fileops.go` - May need updates for temp file handling

#### Reference Implementation
- See `tests/test16_final_memory_approach.go` for working example
- See `docs/memory_processing_summary.md` for implementation pattern
- See `docs/api_knowledge.md` for API reference

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Merging uses minimal temporary files (only during page extraction)
- [ ] Original PDF data kept in memory throughout process
- [ ] Graceful handling of pages that fail extraction
- [ ] Memory usage ~50% of original file sizes
- [ ] Proper cleanup of all temporary files
- [ ] Maintains existing interleaved merge pattern (A1, B3, A2, B2, A3, B1)

#### Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour
