# Project Requirements - BlendPDFGo

## Initial Ideas and Needs

### Problem Statement
Need a tool for merging PDF files with special handling for double-sided scanning workflows where pages are scanned separately and need to be interleaved correctly.

### Goals and Objectives
- Merge exactly 2 PDF documents with identical page counts
- Handle double-sided scanning workflow (front pages + back pages in reverse order)
- Provide robust error handling and file management
- Ensure reliable, fast processing with minimal user intervention
- Support cross-platform operation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Target Users
- Users with double-sided document scanning workflows
- Office workers processing scanned documents
- Anyone needing to merge front/back page PDFs correctly

### Key Features (High-Level)
- Automatic PDF file selection and validation
- Intelligent page reversal and interleaving
- Robust error handling with clear feedback
- File organization (archive, output, error directories)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance optimization for large documents

### Constraints and Limitations
- Must process exactly 2 PDF files
- Both PDFs must have identical page counts
- Requires pdfcpu library for PDF processing
- Command-line interface focused (with potential for future UI)

### Success Criteria
- Successfully merges double-sided scanned PDFs
- Handles errors gracefully without data loss
- Processes files quickly and efficiently
- Works reliably across different operating systems
- Provides clear feedback to users

## Requirements List

### R1: Core PDF Processing Requirements
- **R1.1** Merge exactly 2 PDF documents
- **R1.2** Both documents must have the exact same number of pages
- **R1.3** Error out immediately and move files to error directory if page counts don't match
- **R1.4** Process second document's pages in reverse order during merging
- **R1.5** Use interleaved merging pattern: Doc1_Page1, Doc2_PageLast, Doc1_Page2, Doc2_PageSecondLast, etc.
- **R1.6** Validate that both files are valid PDF documents before processing
- **R1.7** Provide clear error messages for validation failures

### R2: Smart Page Reversal Requirements
- **R2.1** Single-page second file: Direct merge (no reversal needed)
- **R2.2** Multi-page second file: Extract pages individually in reverse order, then merge
- **R2.3** Use separate `api.TrimFile` calls for each page to ensure proper ordering
- **R2.4** Clean up temporary extracted files after processing

### R3: File Handling Requirements
- **R3.1** Success: Move both input files to `archive/` directory
- **R3.2** Success: Place merged PDF in `output/` directory
- **R3.3** Error: Move both input files to `error/` directory if processing fails
- **R3.4** Automatically select the first two PDF files found in the directory (sorted alphabetically)
- **R3.5** Create archive/, output/, error/ directories if missing

### R4: User Interface Requirements
- **R4.1** Command-line interface with clear progress indicators
- **R4.2** Real-time feedback during processing
- **R4.3** Color-coded status messages (success, warning, error)
- **R4.4** Session statistics and processing summaries
- **R4.5** Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

### R5: Performance Requirements
- **R5.1** Process files efficiently with minimal memory usage
- **R5.2** Support large PDF files (100+ pages)
- **R5.3** Optimize for speed while maintaining reliability
- **R5.4** Handle multiple processing sessions without degradation

### R6: Cross-Platform Requirements
- **R6.1** Support Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **R6.2** Handle different file path conventions
- **R6.3** Graceful fallback for legacy terminal environments
- **R6.4** Consistent behavior across platforms

### R7: Error Handling Requirements
- **R7.1** Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- **R7.2** Safe file handling with no data loss
- **R7.3** Recovery mechanisms for failed operations
- **R7.4** Clear error messages with suggested solutions

### R8: Configuration Requirements
- **R8.1** Support configuration files for user preferences
- **R8.2** Customizable output directories and naming
- **R8.3** Configurable processing options
- **R8.4** Settings persistence across sessions
