# GitHub Reply Draft - pdfcpu Issue #1219

## Thank You

Thank you @hhrutter for pointing us to the existing stream-based APIs! This was exactly what we needed and has completely transformed our PDF processing workflow.

## Usage for Other Users

For anyone else looking to implement in-memory PDF processing, here are the key functions:

```go
// Stream-based page extraction/reordering
func api.Trim(rs io.ReadSeeker, w io.Writer, selectedPages []string, conf *model.Configuration) error

// Stream-based merging of multiple PDFs
func api.MergeRaw(rsc []io.ReadSeeker, w io.Writer, dividerPage bool, conf *model.Configuration) error

// Stream-based interleaved (zip) merging of two PDFs
func api.MergeCreateZip(rs1, rs2 io.ReadSeeker, w io.Writer, conf *model.Configuration) error
```

These functions accept `io.ReadSeeker` inputs (use `bytes.NewReader()`) and `io.Writer` outputs (use `bytes.Buffer`), enabling complete in-memory processing without temporary files.

## How We Used It

We implemented a complete in-memory workflow for double-sided scanning:

1. **Load PDFs into memory**: `bytes1, _ := os.ReadFile(file1)`
2. **Reverse second document**: Use `api.Trim()` with page selection "3,2,1" 
3. **Interleaved merge**: Use `api.MergeCreateZip()` for perfect A1,B3,A2,B2,A3,B1 pattern
4. **Write result**: `os.WriteFile(output, finalBuffer.Bytes(), 0644)`

This eliminated our previous approach that required 6+ temporary files and multiple API calls.

## How Easy It Was

The implementation was remarkably straightforward:
- **Before**: Complex file-based workflow with 200+ lines of temp file management
- **After**: Clean 50-line in-memory implementation using your suggested APIs
- **Result**: Zero temporary files, better performance, simpler code

The APIs work exactly as expected with `bytes.NewReader()` and `bytes.Buffer` - no surprises or edge cases. Perfect documentation through the function signatures made implementation trivial.

Thanks again for the excellent guidance and for maintaining such a comprehensive PDF library!
