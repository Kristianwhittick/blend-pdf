# Documentation Review Analysis - Task 18

## Recommendations for Task 19 Implementation

### Action 1: Reorganize API Files
**Current Structure**:
- `api_knowledge.md`: Function reference
- `api_experiments_procedures.md`: Test results
- `memory_processing_research.md`: Research conclusions

**Recommended Structure**:
- Keep `api_knowledge.md` as primary API reference
- Move experiment summaries from `api_experiments_procedures.md` to `api_knowledge.md`
- Keep `api_experiments_procedures.md` for detailed test procedures only
- Keep `memory_processing_research.md` for research conclusions


### Action 2: Update Cross-References
**Steps**:
- Create consistent reference format across all files
- Update all internal links after file renames/deletions
- Add navigation section to main files
- Ensure README.md references are updated


## Implementation Notes for Task 19

- Verify no unique content is lost during consolidation
- Update all cross-references after file changes
- Test that all links work after reorganization
