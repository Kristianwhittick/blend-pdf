# Amazon Q Development Processes

## Overview
This document captures the working processes and methodologies developed during the BlendPDFGo project collaboration with Amazon Q. These processes have proven effective for software development, research, and project management.

## 1. Task Management Process

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Task Creation**: Document in `docs/tasks.md` with status, requirements, priority, and acceptance criteria
2. **Research Phase**: Conduct experiments, document findings, create proof-of-concepts
3. **Implementation Phase**: Code changes with comprehensive testing
4. **Validation Phase**: Unit tests, integration tests, functional verification
5. **Documentation Phase**: Update docs, API knowledge, and task status
6. **Completion**: Move from "Next Stages" to "Completed Tasks" section
7. **Summary Update**: Update compact task summary at top of tasks.md with new counts and status

### Task Status Indicators
- **üìã READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: Research complete, ready to code
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Implementation done, tested, documented
- **üîÑ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (ON HOLD)**: Ready but waiting for approval
- **‚ùå CANCELLED**: Task cancelled with reason documented

### Task Summary Maintenance
- **Compact Summary**: Maintain overview at top of `docs/tasks.md` with current counts
- **Status Categories**: Group tasks by development phase and completion status
- **Progress Tracking**: Update summary with each task completion
- **Production Status**: Reflect overall project readiness and available enhancements

### Priority System
- **High**: Critical functionality, user-requested features, major improvements
- **Medium**: Code quality, performance optimizations, nice-to-have features
- **Low**: Community contributions, documentation improvements, future enhancements

## 2. Research and Experimentation Process

### API Research Methodology
1. **Create Experiment Directory**: `experiments/expXX/` for each test
2. **Unified Runner**: Use `experiments/run_experiments.go` for consistent execution
3. **Document Results**: Update `docs/api_knowledge.md` with findings
4. **Test Procedures**: Document in `docs/api_experiments_procedures.md`

### Experiment Naming Convention
- **Format**: `experimentXX_description.go`
- **Examples**: 
  - `experiment01_pagecount.go` - Basic API testing
  - `experiment20_zip_merge_basic.go` - New feature discovery
  - `experiment22_complete_zip_flow.go` - Full workflow validation

### Research Documentation Pattern
```markdown
#### Experiment XX: Description ‚úÖ
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Goal**: What we're testing
- **Result**: SUCCESS/FAILURE - What happened
- **File**: experiment_filename.go
```

## 4. Documentation Process

### Documentation Types
1. **API Knowledge**: `docs/api_knowledge.md` - Technical API reference
2. **Task Management**: `docs/tasks.md` - Project roadmap and status
3. **Testing Procedures**: `docs/testing.md` - Comprehensive test plans
4. **User Documentation**: `README.md` - User-facing information
5. **Process Documentation**: `AmazonQ.md` - Working processes (this file)

### Documentation Standards
- **Keep Current**: Update docs with every change
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related documents
- **Examples**: Include code examples and use cases
- **Status Tracking**: Mark completion status clearly
- **Version History**: Document what changed and when

### Documentation Review Process
1. **Content Analysis**: Identify overlaps and gaps
2. **Consolidation**: Merge duplicate information
3. **Reorganization**: Improve structure and navigation
4. **Cleanup**: Remove outdated or redundant content
5. **Validation**: Ensure accuracy and completeness

---

## 5. Git Workflow Process

### Commit Message Standards
```
<type>: <short description>

<detailed description>
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3
```

### Commit Types
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Release Process
1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with version entry
2. **Commit changelog** changes
3. **Update VERSION constant** in constants.go
4. **Commit version sync**
5. **Create git tag** with version and changelog
6. **Push all changes** and tags
7. **Verify automated release** via GitHub Actions

### Critical Release Requirements
- Git tag must include both CHANGELOG.md entry and VERSION constant update
- GitHub Actions extracts changelog content from the tagged commit
- Version sync must happen before tagging, not after

## 6. Problem-Solving Methodology

### Discovery Process
1. **Problem Identification**: Clearly define what needs to be solved
2. **Research Phase**: Investigate existing solutions and APIs
3. **Experimentation**: Create proof-of-concepts and test approaches
4. **Analysis**: Compare options and identify best solution
5. **Implementation**: Build and test the solution
6. **Validation**: Verify it solves the original problem

### Breakthrough Pattern Recognition
- **API Discovery**: Look for native functions that eliminate workarounds
- **Simplification**: Prefer fewer API calls and temporary files
- **Performance**: Measure before/after improvements
- **Maintainability**: Choose solutions that are easier to understand and modify

### Example: Zip Merge Breakthrough
1. **Problem**: Complex loop-based PDF interleaving (6+ temp files, 7+ API calls)
2. **Discovery**: Found `MergeCreateZipFile` API for interleaved merging
3. **Research**: Experiments 20-22 validated the approach
4. **Solution**: 2-step process (CollectFile + MergeCreateZipFile)
5. **Result**: 1 temp file, 2 API calls, same output pattern

## 7. Quality Assurance Process

### Testing Hierarchy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
3. **Functional Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Speed and resource usage testing
5. **Regression Tests**: Ensure no functionality breaks

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Overall Coverage**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Critical Functions**: 100% coverage for core functionality
- **Error Paths**: All error conditions tested
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before release
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Performance improvements measured and documented
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
