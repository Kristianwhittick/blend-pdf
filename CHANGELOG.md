## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Undo/Restore functionality with [U] option in interactive menu
- Operation tracking for single file and merge operations
- Consistent file conflict resolution across all operations
- Archive preservation during undo operations
- PowerShell 5/CMD compatibility with terminal detection and legacy UI fallback
- Enhanced keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation (F1, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+Z, etc.)
- Multiple input methods: descriptive words, numbers, and control key combinations
- Terminal capability detection for automatic UI selection

### Fixed
- Merge operations now respect --no-archive flag (previously only single file operations did)
- File conflict handling: all operations now generate unique names instead of overwriting
- Consistent behavior between single file and merge operations for archiving

- TERM environment variable no longer overrides Windows terminal detection on Windows systems

### Changed
- Both single file and merge operations now consistently respect CONFIG.ArchiveMode setting
- Undo operations restore clean "pre-operation" state with files only in main directory
- Enhanced conflict resolution tracks actual filenames used (including _1, _2 suffixes)
- Automatic UI selection: enhanced for modern terminals, basic for legacy environments
- Cross-platform compatibility with graceful fallback for limited terminals
